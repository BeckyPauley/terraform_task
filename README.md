# Exercise 2 : Terraform Task

This Repository contains the final Terraform config file for the task, along with a template for the tfvars file (with sensitive data removed).
The config file creates an S3 Bucket with the name "example-test-bucket-0002" (unless already exists) and blocks all public access to the bucket.

## Terraform CLI commands used:

- terraform init
- terraform fmt
- terraform validate
- terraform plan
- terraform apply
